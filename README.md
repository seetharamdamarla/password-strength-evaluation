## 🧪 Passwords Tested & Results

| Password            | Score | Feedback                                  |
|---------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------|
| 8u*QjV$z@XZ#        | 100%  | Very strong – full character variety.      |
| admin               | 7%    | Very weak – common and too simple.         |
| password123         | 43%   | Weak – predictable and lacks symbols.      |
| Abcdefg!            | 39%   | Weak – sequential characters.              |
| Th1sIs$Str0ng       | 100%  | Very strong – passphrase style with mix.   |

## 🛡️ Key Concepts & Learnings

### ✅ Best Practices for Strong Passwords:
- Use **at least 12 characters**
- Combine **uppercase**, **lowercase**, **numbers**, and **symbols**
- Avoid common words and predictable sequences
- Prefer **passphrases** over short complex words
- Never reuse passwords across accounts
- Use a **password manager** for storage and generation
- Enable **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**

---

## 🔎 How Password Complexity Affects Security

- Increases total possible combinations
- Makes brute-force and dictionary attacks slower or ineffective
- Prevents guessability using common patterns
- Improves overall system resilience against intrusion attempts

## 🧪 Common Password Attacks

| Attack Type         | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| **Brute Force**     | Tries all possible character combinations. |
| **Dictionary**      | Uses common password lists to guess. |
| **Credential Stuffing** | Tries leaked credentials from other sites. |
| **Phishing**        | Tricks users into giving away passwords. |
| **Keylogging**      | Malware records your keystrokes. |

✅ Conclusion 🔐💡
Through this task, I learned the importance of creating strong, complex passwords 🧠🔒. Testing different password styles helped me understand how length, character diversity, and unpredictability make a big difference in resisting attacks like brute force and dictionary guessing 🚫🛠️.

Combining best practices (like using passphrases, password managers 🔑, and enabling multi-factor authentication 🔐📲) ensures better protection of accounts and sensitive data.
This activity has enhanced my awareness of real-world password threats and how to defend against them effectively 🛡️✅.
